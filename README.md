## Programming Languages

Offered by the University of Washington and taught by Professor Dan Grossman, this course explores the foundational concepts of programming languages.
It focuses on functional, object-oriented, and modular programming paradigms through hands-on experience in Standard ML, Racket, and Ruby. Key topics include recursion, closures, higher-order functions, lexical scoping, type systems, and language evaluation strategies. The course emphasizes deep understanding of programming language design and the principles that unify seemingly different languages.
